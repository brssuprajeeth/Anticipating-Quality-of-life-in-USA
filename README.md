# Anticipating-Quality-of-life-in-USA

**Overview**

A minimum wage is the lowest remuneration that employers can legally pay their employees. The minimum wage in the United States is set by U.S. labor law and a range of state and local laws. Federal governments use minimum wage laws to ensure a basic quality of life among all citizens within its borders. These laws attempt to improve an individual's position in the economic income brackets. The federal minimum wage in the United States is $7.25. It is meant to be a living wage, but this isn't the case in practice. The hourly rate hasn't kept up with the cost of living since the late 1960s.In this project, we are looking at the need for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 and predict the quality of life index in terms of Consumer Price Index(CPI), by using the publicly available data.
